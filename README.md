Example code and guides for accomplishing common tasks with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key ([create a free account here](https://beta.openai.com/signup)).

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.

## Contributing

The OpenAI Cookbook is a community-driven resource.  Your efforts are much valued, whether you're proposing an idea, correcting a typo, creating a new guide, or upgrading an already existing one.

Read through the current problems and pull requests before making a contribution to determine whether anything comparable is currently being worked on by someone else. By doing so, you can prevent effort duplication.

Please feel free to make suggestions on the  [issues page](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/issues) for any examples or directions for use that you'd want to see.

Make sure to read our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to add new content. As long as they adhere to our standards and are within the cookbook's purview, we encourage the contribution of fresh, high-caliber examples and instructions.
